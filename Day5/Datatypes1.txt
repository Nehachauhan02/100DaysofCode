Topic : Data types
Data types specify the different sizes and values that can be stored in the variable. 
There are two types of data types in Java:
1. Primitive data types: The primitive data types include boolean, char, byte, short, int, long, float and double.
2. Non-primitive data types: The non-primitive data types include Classes, Interfaces, and Arrays.

A byte is an 8-bit signed integer.
A short is a 16-bit signed integer.
An int is a 32-bit signed integer.
A long is a 64-bit signed integer.

Input Format

The first line contains an integer,T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case,T, is comprised of a single line with an integer,n, which can be arbitrarily large or small.

Output Format

For each input variable n and appropriate primitive dataType, you must determine if the given primitives are capable of storing it.
If yes, then print:
n can be fitted in:
* dataType

If there is more than one appropriate data type, print each one on its own line and order them by size (i.e.:byte < short < int < long).

If the number cannot be stored in one of the four aforementioned primitives, 
print the line:
n can't be fitted anywhere.

Sample Input:
Test case 1: 5
Test case 2: -150

Sample Output:
Test case 1: -150 can be fitted in:
Test case 2:* short
